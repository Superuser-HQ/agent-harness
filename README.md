# SHQ Agent Harness

A lean, open-source agent harness for multi-agent collaboration.

**Status:** Early design phase

## What is this?

An agent harness — not a chatbot framework — that treats scaffolding, feedback loops, and mechanical enforcement as first-class concerns. Built by [SuperuserHQ](https://github.com/sunnysideupweb).

### Design Principles

1. **Harness-first** — scaffolding and feedback loops ARE the product
2. **Compound by default** — every task leaves the system smarter
3. **Mechanical enforcement** — encode taste into code, not prose
4. **Start smaller than you think** — thin core + extensions
5. **Agent legibility** — if it's not in the repo, it doesn't exist
6. **Distributed ownership** — bus-factor > 1 from day one
